# Shards - Accounts UI for Ant Design

This package provides _very basic_ UI elements for common user account workflows, built using Ant Design.

**This is considered to be W.I.P.**

### Assumptions:

- You are building a React application
- You want to use Ant Design for the UI

## Quick start

This package only provides the UI elements, but doesn't provide any real functionality.
[@moxb/shards-accounts-flow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moxb/shards-accounts-flow) provides
a full login work-flow with automatic redirection.
