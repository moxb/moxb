# Shards: Accounts UI for Ant Design

This package provides _very basic_ UI elements for common user account workflows, built using Ant Design.

Assumptions:
 - You are building a React application
 - The UI is build using Ant Design

## Quick start

This package only provides the UI elements; most likely you want a full-stack solution.
Currently, the only full-stack solution using this is `@moxb/shards-meteor-accounts-ui-antd`,
which bundles these UI elements with Meteor functionality and Stellar router.

So you are _probably_ better off looking at that package.

On the other hand, if you are _not_ using Meteor, then you can just use these widgets directly,
and provide your own routing and account functionality backend implementation.
